QUALITY RULES:

- All 4 options must be plausible — avoid obviously wrong distractors.
- Questions must be appropriate for the specified grade level.
- The "lesson" field must always be a real, specific topic name from the
  subject's standard syllabus (e.g. "Algebra", "Photosynthesis") — never the

- Every question MUST test a DIFFERENT specific fact, concept, or skill.
- DO NOT repeat or rephrase any other question in this same batch.
- DO NOT cluster questions around one narrow sub-topic within a subject.
- Where a subject lists "EXISTING QUESTIONS TO AVOID", none of your new questions for that
  subject may repeat or closely rephrase any of them.

VARIETY REQUIREMENTS — mix ALL of the following styles across the set:
- Factual recall, application, cause-and-effect, comparison, scenario/real-world,
  negation (sparingly), and numerical/formula-based (for maths/science where appropriate).

QUALITY RULES:
- Each question must have EXACTLY 4 options.
- correct_answer must be EXACTLY one of the 4 options (copy it verbatim).
- All 4 options must be plausible — avoid obviously wrong distractors.
- Questions must be appropriate for the specified grade level.
- "subject" MUST be copied verbatim from the requested subject list below — never invent or rename one.
- "lesson" must be a real, specific topic name from that subject's standard syllabus — never the
  subject name itself and never generic ("General", "Miscellaneous", etc).
- Do NOT include numbering in the question text.
- Do NOT output anything outside the JSON object.

  those entries (their subject/topic/reason/recommended_action), in priority
  order. You may rephrase them in a warmer, more encouraging tone, but do not
  contradict them or change which subjects/topics they point to.
- If "recommendations" is empty: there isn't enough data yet — give general,
  encouraging, non-numeric guidance instead (e.g. "keep practising regularly").

CRITICAL — do not invent numbers: every accuracy percentage, attempt count, or
other statistic you mention MUST come directly from the provided data. Never
fabricate or estimate a number that isn't present in the input. If you don't
have a specific figure for something, describe it qualitatively instead
